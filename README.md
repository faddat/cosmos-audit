Needed work in the absence of information from the interchain foundation

As a cosmos contributor, I am concerned about the state of reporting from interchain.io

I am concerned that there are people in the cosmos ecosystem who'd prefer that I do not pursue this search for information.  I feel strongly that the Interchain foundation should publish information about the state of its finances and its arrangements with actors in the ecosystem.  The last available report from the interchain foundation is from q1 2021 and I think it's quite fair to say that at best, the report is vague. 

I'll assemble all infomration on this matter here, and anyone is welcome to make pull requests.

For now, this effort will concern only cosmoshub-4, but can be moved backwards to cosmoshub1-3 if need be.  

## Wallets of concern

I'm mainly interested in the histories of: 


* [ICF Multisig](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/master/accounts/icf/multisig.json)
  * cosmos1unc788q8md2jymsns24eyhua58palg5kc7cstv
    * 6083156.55 atoms
  * cosmos1z8mzakma7vnaajysmtkwt4wgjqr2m84tzvyfkz 
    * 14194031.94 atoms 
* [AIB Multisig](https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet/blob/f391b3ef4159a506bd16f71ddf02cc8b1a0d310a/accounts/aib/multisig.json)
  * cosmos176m2p8l3fps3dal7h8gf9jvrv98tu3rqfdht86
    * 21842188.81 atoms


I'm also mainly concerned because there are many claims about transparency floating around.

Opacity is fine and the chains themselves are transparent enough, so let's get to work.

Making a fresh gaia archive node.
